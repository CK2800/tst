Shooting
A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List the possible reasons for the man not dying.
1. She missed.

3. The man was already dead.
4. The gun malfunctioned.
5. The man targeted and the man not dying are not the same.
6. The man was too far away.
7. There was no bullet in the chamber.

Alien
An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-by-step instruction.  List the steps.  Be as detailed as you can. (Example: Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap anti-clockwise)
PRE: Toothbrush, toothpaste and faucet are available in bathroom.
0. Go into the bathroom.
1. Take the toothpaste tube.
2. Hold the toothpaste tube with your left hand.
3. Turn the cap anti-clockwise with your right hand.
4. Put cap on sink.
5. Take the toothbrush with your right hand.
6. Hold toothbrush tube horizontally with your left hand.
7. Hold toothbrush adjacent to cap end of toothpaste tube with brushes up.
8. The top end of the brushes should be at the lower rim of the toothpaste tube nozzle.
9. Gently apply enough pressure to toothpaste tube until toothpaste emerges from the nozzle.
10. Keep pressure on toothpaste tube until emerged toothpaste resembles the width of the toothbrush.
11. Stop adding pressure to the toothbrush tube.
12. Lift toothpaste off the nozzle with the toothbrush by lifting your right hand.
13. Place toothbrush in mouth so that the brushes are behind your teeth.
14. Hold toothbrush in mouth by gently biting it.
15. Place toothpaste tube on sink.
16. Grab toothbrush with one hand.
17. Move toothbrush inward in mouth on top of teeth in lower left side of mouth.
18. Move toothbrush in opposite direction.
19. Repeat for 30 seconds. (Do you have a watch or know of the concept and where to buy?)
20. ... repeat and rinse ... yawn.

#1 Pros and cons of TDD (subjective).
#2 Pros
* We can be confident in refactoring the software knowing that we have tests to ensure functionality.
* The principles of IoC and DI leads to cleaner code.
* Clearer responsibility of the UUT.
* The above leads to more and smaller methods, some of them pure.
* Red green refactor implicitly tells us that Q&D code is ok, we will refactor later
* TDD promotes the what if... thinking so that focus on special cases arises (0, negative values, upper limits, deltas).
* ...
#2 Cons
* Sometimes tedious work (more focus on equivalence partitioning might be handy).
* Hard to refrain from doing more work in methods that we know we will need at a later stage.
